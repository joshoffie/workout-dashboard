    <h1>Terms of Service for Trunk</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 2026</p>
    
    <p>Welcome to Trunk ("we," "our," or "us"). Trunk is a digital fitness tracking application designed to help you log and visualize your workouts.</p>
    
    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully. By downloading, accessing, or using the Trunk web or mobile application (the "App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to all of these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h3>1. Medical and Fitness Disclaimer (Not a Coach or Doctor)</h3>
    <p>Trunk is a data-logging tool, not a healthcare provider, medical professional, or certified personal trainer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Medical Advice:</strong> The App does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider before starting or altering any exercise program.</li>
        <li><strong>No Prescriptive Coaching:</strong> Trunk is designed to record the data you input. It does not dictate what you should do. Any suggestions, goal tracking, or historical comparisons provided by the App are strictly for informational purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Algorithmic Estimates:</strong> Features such as 1-Rep Max (1RM) calculations, goal progress, and "Smart Recaps" are mathematical approximations generated by algorithms based on your past inputs. They are <strong>not</strong> recommendations, instructions, or guarantees that you are physically capable of lifting a specific weight safely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Assumption of Risk</h3>
    <p>Weightlifting, strength training, and physical exercise carry an inherent and significant risk of property damage, severe bodily injury, or death.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By using Trunk, you expressly acknowledge and accept that you are solely responsible for your own safety, form, and equipment while exercising.</li>
        <li>You agree that you are voluntarily participating in these activities and assume all physical risks. Trunk and its creators shall not be held liable for any injuries (e.g., muscle tears, joint damage, dropped weights) sustained before, during, or after using the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Distraction Warning:</strong> Do not interact with the App (including interacting with timers, graphs, or inputs) while actively performing a physical lift.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Data Storage, Syncing, and Loss</h3>
    <p>Trunk utilizes cloud-based infrastructure and local device storage (offline mode) to save your workout data.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>No Guarantee of Data Retention:</strong> While we strive to keep your data secure and synchronized, we do not guarantee that your workout history, custom timers, custom settings, or account data will not be lost, corrupted, or permanently deleted due to server outages, app updates, or sync conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Your Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for ensuring your data is accurate. Trunk is not liable for any emotional distress, inconvenience, or perceived financial loss resulting from missing or deleted workout data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Account Registration and Security</h3>
    <p>To access your data across devices, you must authenticate using third-party services (such as Google or Apple).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your device and account credentials.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to suspend, disable, or terminate your account at our sole discretion if we suspect unauthorized use, malicious activity, or a violation of these Terms.</li>
        <li>You may delete your account and associated data at any time via the Settings menu within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. "As Is" Service and Disclaimer of Warranties</h3>
    <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Trunk explicitly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, or statutory.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not warrant that the App will be error-free, completely secure, or operate without interruptions.</li>
        <li>We do not warrant that native device features triggered by the App (such as haptic feedback, background timers, or flashlight alerts) will function reliably at all times.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Trunk, its developers, affiliates, and partners shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to injuries, data loss, or device damage, arising out of your use or inability to use the App.</p>
    <p>In no event shall our aggregate liability for all claims related to the App exceed the total amount you have paid us to use the App over the past twelve (12) months. If you use the App for free, our maximum liability to you is $0.00.</p>

    <h3>7. Intellectual Property</h3>
    <p>All content, design, code, graphics (including custom spiral UI visualizers), and algorithms within the App are the exclusive property of Trunk. You may not copy, reverse-engineer, distribute, or create derivative works from the App without our express written permission.</p>

    <h3>8. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
    <p>These Terms and your use of the App shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding related to these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

    <h3>9. Changes to These Terms</h3>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this document or by displaying a prominent notice within the App. Your continued use of the App following the posting of updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>
